/**
 * Section-level auth gate for the `(dashboard)` route group.
 *
 * Auth.js v5 ships an `auth()` wrapper that, used as middleware, populates
 * `request.auth` from the session cookie. We then either let the request
 * through or bounce to `/api/auth/signin` with a `callbackUrl` so the user
 * lands back where they were trying to go after signing in.
 *
 * The matcher enumerates URL paths (route groups like `(dashboard)` aren't
 * part of the URL, so we can't match by group name). Add new dashboard
 * pages here when they're created.
 *
 * Pedagogical note: this is the section-level auth pattern. `/messages/send`
 * et al. previously had per-page `await auth()` checks; with this middleware
 * in place those checks become dead code and were removed. The one-off
 * per-page pattern is still demonstrated on `/profile`.
